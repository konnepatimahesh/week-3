# 📊 Power BI-Driven Exhaustive Analysis on Indian Agriculture Sector 🇮🇳🌾
Excited to share my latest Power BI project, where I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Indian Agriculture Sector using interactive visualizations and data insights.

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
✅ State-wise Crop Production Trends
✅ Seasonal Contribution (Autumn, Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Whole Year)
✅ Year-wise Analysis of Agricultural Land Usage
✅ Geospatial Analysis of Production Across India
✅ Comparison of Production Over the Years

📌 Interesting Findings:
📌 2005 recorded the highest sum of area (hectares), showing a notable increase compared to other years.
📌 Total production stands at 45.17bn tons, with variations across different crop years.
📌 Declining trend in agricultural land usage observed in recent years.

💡 This project helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization, trend analysis, and storytelling with Power BI.

🚀 Looking forward to more such explorations and open to discussions on improving agricultural analytics using AI & data science!
